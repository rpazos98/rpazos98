### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Rodrigo Pazos

I'm a Software Engineer graduated from Universidad Austral (5 years course) and I'm currently working at MuleSoft as Software Engineer MTS.

I tend to work in Java :coffee:, Python :snake: and Scala as a backend developer, but I have some expercience developing with React.

I love reading about systems desing, programming paradigms and engineering teams managment.
