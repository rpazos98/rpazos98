### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Rodrigo Pazos

I'm a Software Engineer graduated from Universidad Austral (5 years course). I'm also an ex-Muley (Software Engineer MTS).

I tend to work in Java :coffee:, Python :snake: and Scala :ladder: as a backend developer. I also have some expercience developing with React.

I love reading about systems design, programming paradigms and engineering teams managment.
